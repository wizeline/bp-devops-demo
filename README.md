### New Service On-boarding
- environment creation for new services (simple, blue-green) (video)
- CICD creation for new services (video)

- automated build/unit-test/lint/secret-scan (video)
- automated deployment (video)
- automated regression tests
- automated sanity tests
- automated deployment for blue-green environments

### Other
- chaos lambda for ec2 and k8s

## Feedback System
- logs ands reference dashboard
- status-light and dashboard
- status-page
- prometheus/grafana/alertmanager for k8s
- logging/error-reporting in stackdriver
- build-info
- uptime/latency/failure statistics
- traefik dashboards for services dns
- rabbit clusters dashboards
- chronograf for metrics graphs
- UAT environments (dark production environment)

## Continuous Learning/Improvement
- errors review meeting every week
- sprint retrospective
- pr reviews

## What is next?

- improvements of automation systems
- increase test coverages
- collect metrics, analyze and do experiments to improve metrics
- plan "play days"
- continue working on the FMEA matrix and resiliency tests
- continue working on the disaster recovery and business continuity
- automate secrets rotation
